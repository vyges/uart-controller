This repository is a starter template creating open-source and reusable Vyges-compatible SystemVerilog IP blocks â€” with built-in support for simulation, documentation, waveforms, and OpenLane-based GDS generation.

### ðŸš€ Getting started

1. Rename the repo to your IPâ€™s name.
2. Replace the contents of this `README.md` with your own.
3. Copy from `README.template.md` to jump-start the structure and filling in the required fields like:

   * IP block name, description, features
   * Diagram or block interface
   * Usage, test instructions, licensing

4. Copy from or rename `vyges-metadata.template.json` â†’ to `vyges-metadata.json` and fill in your metadata
5. Update module names, parameters and ports
6. Update documentation files in `docs/` (like `architecture.md`, `waveforms.md`)
7. Run your first simulation and flow.
